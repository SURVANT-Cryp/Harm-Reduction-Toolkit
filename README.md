# Harm-Reduction-Toolkit

The main objective of the SURVANT-Cryp Harm Reduction Toolkit is to connect homeless individuals struggling with substance abuse and other serious issues to social justice organizations, programs and networks primarily focused on harm reduction. Many of the groups listed in the toolkit utilize a variety of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with substance use and sexual activity. Resources for victims of domestic violence are also included in the toolkit due to the large number of instances where substance use is a factor in cases of physical abuse. Most of us can only imagine, from a comfortable distance, the survival stratagems developed by people living on the periphery of mainstream society. Individuals who have been historically excluded from institutions of knowledge production can offer unique, relevant and critically important contributions to our understanding of the contemporary world thanks in part to their different lived experiences. With that said, I hope this tool will help homeless individuals to locate and access the resources they require to reduce harm and allow this population to have greater input into the creation of programs and policies designed to serve them. I also hope the tool will inspire others to establish similar transgressive, polyvocal campaigns, networks, tactical media interventions and distros aimed at combating homelessness, substance abuse and domestic violence in New York City and beyond.<br>

The SURVANT-Cryp Harm Reduction Toolkit was inspired by the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), a project by Electronic Disturbance Theater that provides immigrants crossing the U.S./Mexico border with safe routes and directions to water caches (maintained by the Border Angels) throughout the desert.<br>
