#SURVANT-Cryp Harm Reduction Toolkit

A collection of harm reduction resources (maps, guides, websites and educational materials) specifically tailored to homeless individuals.<br>

The main objective of the toolkit is to help connect homeless people struggling with substance use and other serious issues to organizations, programs and networks focused on harm reduction. Many of the resources listed in the toolkit utilize a variety of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with substance use and sexual activity. Resources for victims of domestic violence are also included in the toolkit due to the significant number of occurences where substance use is a factor in physical and psychological abuse cases. Most of us can only imagine, from a comfortable distance, the survival stratagems developed by people living on the periphery of mainstream society. Individuals who have been historically excluded from institutions of knowledge production can offer unique, relevant and critically important contributions to our understanding of the contemporary world thanks in large part to their different lived experience. With that said, I hope this tool will help homeless individuals locate and access the resources they require to reduce harm and also allow them to have greater input into the creation of programs and policies designed to fight homelessness, substance abuse and domestic violence. I also hope the tool will inspire others to establish similar transgressive, polyvocal campaigns, networks, tactical media interventions and distros in New York City and beyond.<br>

The SURVANT-Cryp Harm Reduction Toolkit was inspired by the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), a mobile technology project by Electronic Disturbance Theater that provides immigrants crossing the U.S./Mexico border with safe routes and directions to water caches (maintained by the Border Angels) throughout the desert.<br>
