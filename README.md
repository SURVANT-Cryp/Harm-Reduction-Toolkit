#SURVANT-Cryp REDUCE Toolkit

A collection of harm reduction resources (maps, guides, websites and educational materials) specifically tailored to homeless individuals in New York City.<br>

The main objective of the toolkit is to help connect homeless people struggling with substance use and other serious issues to a variety of harm reduction services and therapies in New York City. The groups and organizations listed in the toolkit utilize practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Resources for victims of domestic and sexual violence are also included in the toolkit due to the significant number of occurences where substance use is a factor in physical and sexual abuse cases. Nearly 60 percent of women experiencing homelessness report that domestic violence was the cause of their homelessness and more than 90 percent have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence.<br>

Most of us can only imagine—from a comfortable distance—the survival stratagems developed by people living on the periphery of mainstream society. Individuals who have been historically excluded from institutions of knowledge production can offer unique, relevant and critically important contributions to our understanding of the contemporary world (thanks in large part to their different lived experiences). With that said, I hope this tool will help homeless individuals locate and access the resources they require to reduce harm and also allow them to have greater input into the creation of programs and policies designed to fight homelessness, substance abuse and domestic violence. I also hope the tool will inspire others to establish similar transgressive, polyvocal campaigns, networks, tactical media interventions and distros in New York City and beyond.<br>

The SURVANT-Cryp REDUCE Toolkit was inspired by the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), a mobile technology project by Electronic Disturbance Theater that provides immigrants crossing the U.S./Mexico border with safe routes and directions to water caches throughout the desert.<br>

I am sharing this project on GitHub in the spirit of distribution and DIWO culture.<br>
